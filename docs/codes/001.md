# parse a workflow file as YAML: EOF

```console
$ ghalint run
ERRO[0000] read a workflow file                          error="parse a workflow file as YAML: EOF" program=ghalint version=0.2.6 workflow_file_path=.github/workflows/test.yaml
```

This error occurs if the workflow file has no YAML node.
Probably this means the YAML file is empty or all codes are empty lines or commented out.

## How to solve

1. Fix the workflow file
1. Move or rename the workflow file to exclude it from targets of ghalint

If this error occurs, probably the YAML file is invalid as a GitHub Actions Workflow.
So this isn't a bug of ghalint.
Please fix the workflow file.
