# read a configuration file: parse configuration file as YAML: EOF

```console
$ ghalint run
FATA[0000] ghalint failed                                config_file=ghalint.yaml error="read a configuration file: parse configuration file as YAML: EOF"
```

This error occurs if the configuration file has no YAML node.
Probably this means the YAML file is empty or all codes are empty lines or commented out.

## How to solve

Please fix the configuration file.
