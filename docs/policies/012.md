# job_timeout_minutes_is_required

All jobs should set [timeout-minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes).

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo: # The job doesn't have `timeout-minutes`
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
```

:o:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
```

## Why?

https://exercism.org/docs/building/github/gha-best-practices#h-set-timeouts-for-workflows

> By default, GitHub Actions kills workflows after 6 hours if they have not finished by then. Many workflows don't need nearly as much time to finish, but sometimes unexpected errors occur or a job hangs until the workflow run is killed 6 hours after starting it. Therefore it's recommended to specify a shorter timeout.
> 
> The ideal timeout depends on the individual workflow but 30 minutes is typically more than enough for the workflows used in Exercism repos.
> 
> This has the following advantages:
> 
> PRs won't be pending CI for half the day, issues can be caught early or workflow runs can be restarted.
> The number of overall parallel builds is limited, hanging jobs will not cause issues for other PRs if they are cancelled early.

## Exceptions

1. All steps set `timeout-minutes`

```yaml
jobs:
  foo: # The job is missing `timeout-minutes`, but it's okay because all steps set timeout-minutes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
        timeout-minutes: 5
      - run: echo bar
        timeout-minutes: 5
```

2. A job uses a reusable workflow

When a reusable workflow is called with `uses`, `timeout-minutes` is not available.

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    uses: suzuki-shunsuke/renovate-config-validator-workflow/.github/workflows/validate.yaml@v0.2.3
```
