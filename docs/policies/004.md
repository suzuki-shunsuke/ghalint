# deny_inherit_secrets

[`secrets: inherit`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsecretsinherit) should not be used

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    uses: suzuki-shunsuke/go-release-workflow/.github/workflows/release.yaml@v0.4.4
    secrets: inherit # `inherit` should not be used
```

:o:

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    uses: suzuki-shunsuke/go-release-workflow/.github/workflows/release.yaml@v0.4.4
    secrets: # Only required secrets should be passed
      gh_app_id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
      gh_app_private_key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

## Why?

Secrets should be exposed to only required jobs.
