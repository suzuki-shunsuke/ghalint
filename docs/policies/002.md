# deny_read_all_permission

`read-all` permission should not be used

## Why?

For least privilege.

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
name: test
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: read-all # Don't use read-all
    steps:
      - run: echo foo
```

:o:

```yaml
name: test
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - run: echo foo
```
