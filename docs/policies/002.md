# deny_read_all_permission

[`read-all` permission](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#defining-access-for-the-github_token-scopes) should not be used.

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
name: test
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: read-all # Don't use read-all
    steps:
      - run: echo foo
```

:o:

```yaml
name: test
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - run: echo foo
```

## Why?

For least privilege.
You should grant only necessary permissions.
