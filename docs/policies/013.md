# checkout_persist_credentials_should_be_false

[actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout)'s input `persist-credentials` should be `false`.

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # persist-credentials is not set
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  bar:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # persist-credentials is true
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: "true"
```

:o:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: "false"
```

## Why?

https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/485

Persisting token allows every step after `actions/checkout` to access token.
This is a security risk.

## How to ignore the violation

If you need to persist token in a specific job, please configure it with [the configuration file](../../README.md#configuration-file).

e.g.

ghalint.yaml

```yaml
excludes:
  - policy_name: checkout_persist_credentials_should_be_false
    workflow_file_path: .github/workflows/actionlint.yaml
    job_name: actionlint
```

- workflow: `policy_name`, `workflow_file_path`, `job_name` are required
- action: `policy_name` and `action_file_path` are required
