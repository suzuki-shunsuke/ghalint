# deny_job_container_latest_image

Job's container image tag should not be `latest`.

## Why?

Image tags should be pinned with tag or hash.

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
jobs:
  container-test-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: node:latest
```

â­• 

```yaml
jobs:
  container-test-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: node:10 # Ideally, hash is best
```
