# job_secrets

Job should not set secrets to environment variables.

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{github.token}} # secret is set in job
    steps:
      - run: echo foo
      - run: gh label create bug
```

:o:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - run: echo foo
      - run: gh label create bug
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{github.token}} # secret is set in step
```

## How to fix

Set secrets to steps.

## Why?

Secrets should be exposed to only necessary steps.

## Exceptions

Job has only one step.
