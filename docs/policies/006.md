# job_secrets

Job should not set secrets to environment variables.

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{github.token}} # secret is set in job
    steps:
      - run: echo foo
      - run: gh label create bug
```

:o:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - run: echo foo
      - run: gh label create bug
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{github.token}} # secret is set in step
```

## How to fix

Set secrets to steps.

## Why?

Secrets should be exposed to only necessary steps.

## Exceptions

Job has only one step.

## How to ignore the violation

We don't recommend, but if you want to ignore the violation of this policy, please configure it with [the configuration file](../../README.md#configuration-file).

e.g.

ghalint.yaml

```yaml
excludes:
  - policy_name: job_secrets
    workflow_file_path: .github/workflows/actionlint.yaml
    job_name: actionlint
```

`policy_name`, `workflow_file_path`, and `job_name` are required.
