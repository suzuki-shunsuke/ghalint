# job_permissions

All jobs should have `permissions`

## Why?

For least privilege.

## Exceptions

- workflow's `permissions` is empty `{}`
- workflow has only one job and the workflow has `permissions`

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Without permissions
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
  bar:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Without permissions
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

:o:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: {} # Set permissions
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
  bar:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: # Set permissions
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

Or

```yaml
permissions: {} # empty permissions
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
  bar:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: # Set permissions
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```
