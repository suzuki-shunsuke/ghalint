# job_permissions

All jobs should have the field [permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idpermissions).

## Examples

:x:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo: # The job doesn't have `permissions`
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
```

:o:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: {} # Set permissions
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
```

## Why?

For least privilege.

## Exceptions

1. workflow's `permissions` is empty `{}`

```yaml
permissions: {} # empty permissions
jobs:
  foo: # The job is missing `permissions`, but it's okay because the workflow's `permissions` is empty
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
```

2. workflow has only one job and the workflow has `permissions`

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  foo: # The job is missing `permissions`, but it's okay because the workflow has permissions and the workflow has only one job.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo hello
```
