# action_ref_should_be_full_length_commit_sha

action's ref should be full length commit SHA

## Examples

:x:

```
actions/checkout@v3
```

â­•

```
actions/checkout@ac593985615ec2ede58e132d2e21d2b1cbd6127c # v3
```

## Why?

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions

> Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release.
> Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload

## Exclude

Some actions and reusable workflows don't support pinning version.
You can exclude those actions and reusable workflows.

ghalint.yaml

```yaml
excludes:
  # slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator doesn't support pinning version
  # > Invalid ref: 68bad40844440577b33778c9f29077a3388838e9. Expected ref of the form refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
  # https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/issues/722
  - policy_name: action_ref_should_be_full_length_commit_sha
    action_name: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml
```

`policy_name` and `action_name` are mandatory.
